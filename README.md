# [Unity] Tappy-Plane
## Game originally created on 2018-01.
#### Last opened with Unity Editor version: 2019.2.8f1 ####
<p>Simple "Flappy Bird" clone with different "flap" mechanic. Instead of flaping when tapping on screen, plane flies up when you click and hold the screen.</p>
<p>I've initialy created the game just because at the time I wanted to train my Unity skills and make a playable game.
Thus, the game does not have any sound, since I did not spend any time for searching for sound tracks or effects.</p>
